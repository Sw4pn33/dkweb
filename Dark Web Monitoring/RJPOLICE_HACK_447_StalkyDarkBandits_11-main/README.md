## Problem Statement: Dark Web Monitoring

We aim to develop a tool for monitoring the Dark Web, a hidden part on the internet, to track illegal activities. The tool will include a scraper and crawler that will consistently collects onion sites, crawling for keywords associated with illegal activities such as drugs. For enhanced anonymity, the entire tool will operate on Tails OS, which utilizes relays and Tor services to take anonymity to the next level. Furthermore, the solution or tool service will host itself on the Dark Web for added security.


## Features Summary:

### 1. Enhanced Anonymity using Tails OS

- Tails OS is a live operating system that can be run directly from a USB stick.
- Specifically designed for anonymity, Tails routes all internet traffic through the Tor network, ensuring that all your data passes through a network of relays.

### 2. Hosted on the Onion or Dark Web

- The solution includes automated scripts for setting up and providing the user with a unique onion address within 30 seconds.
- The onion address is temporary and deleted upon shutting down Tails OS, ensuring that no one else can access it. A new onion address is generated each time Tails OS is started.

### 3. Dark Web Scraper and Crawler

- The solution consists of two main phases: The scraper gathers information on onion sites using specified keywords and stores the results.
The crawler actively monitors keywords associated with illegal activities (such as drugs, murder, arms) on scraped websites and alerts relevant onion sites.

### 4. Trend Analytics of Illegal Activities

- Gain valuable insights into trending dark web activities. By entering a keyword (e.g., "Drugs"), our tool reveals the most popular dark web sites related to the query, helping users stay ahead of emerging threats.

### 5. Automated OSINT and Recon on Target Dark Webs

- The solution aims to provide comprehensive information on the back sources of target dark web or onion services.
- Provides confidential information useful for law enforcement.
- Provides precise and user-friendly output of the gathered information.
